Generate a Risk Register Report for a customer account. This report identifies technical risks previously highlighted in support cases and consulting reports, and recommends actions to address them in engagements.

**Focus:** Operations / Risk Management
**DRI:** Technical Services
**Typical Timeline:** ~13 business days (agent accelerates data gathering significantly)

## Step 1 — Gather Account Context and Identify Stakeholders
Ask the user for: account name, motivation (proactive / reactive / renewal / escalation), timeframe (default 6 months), known concerns.

Automated gathering:
- monday_get_tam_accounts({ accountName, includeSubitems: true })
- monday_get_doc({ subitemId }) for the last 4-8 weekly reports
- glean search: "{account} engagement overview", "{account} account team AE CSM", "csm-{account}" (app=slack)

Produce a stakeholder table (AE, CSM, SA, PS, TS, EM, TAM/NTSE) and flag high-context individuals for review later.

## Step 2 — Data Collection
Automated (Glean):
- "{account} consulting report", "{account} professional services", "{account} PS report recommendations"
- "csm-{account}" (app=slack), "{account} risk escalation" (app=slack)
- "{account} post-mortem RCA", "{account} HELP escalation"
- Case clustering & pattern analysis (Glean synthesizes support case themes)
- Per-case deep dive for top escalations (Sev1/Sev2, HELP JIRAs)

STOP after presenting the prompts; do not continue until the user pastes results back.

## Step 3 — Analyze Artifacts
Cross-reference PS report recommendations against case patterns. For each risk candidate assess:
- Severity: Critical / Significant / Roadmap Planning
- Confidence: High / Medium / Low
- Frequency: High / Medium / Low
- Impact of taking no action

Categorize findings by: Connectivity, Performance, Query/Index, Upgrade, Environment/Sizing, Product, Training, Admin, Terraform/CLI/API.

## Step 4 — Draft the Risk Register Report
Use this exact structure. Document is INTERNAL ONLY.

\`\`\`markdown
# {Account Name}: Risk Register Report

INTERNAL DOCUMENT ONLY - NOT TO BE SHARED WITH THE CUSTOMER

**Author(s):** MongoDB Technical Services
**Date Finalized:** {date}

## Executive Summary
{2-3 paragraphs: what prompted this review, the scope (number of cases, timeframe), key findings summary, and why it matters for the account relationship. If evidence is thin, add a caveat about confidence. End with a forward-looking statement about recommended engagement.}

## Key Findings
| # | Risk Identified | Severity | Confidence | Frequency of Risk | Impact of Taking No Action |
|---|-----------------|----------|------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | ... | Critical / Significant / Roadmap Planning | High / Medium / Low | High / Medium / Low | ... |

## Case Review Summary
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Case Review Timeline | {start} to {end} |
| Total Cases Reviewed | {N} |
| Escalated Cases | {N} ({%}) |

**Case breakdown by problem category:**
| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Training / Knowledge gaps | {N} ({%}) |
| Environment / Sizing problem | {N} ({%}) |
| Product (legitimate MongoDB issue) | {N} ({%}) |
| Pending Event | {N} ({%}) |
| Administrative issue | {N} ({%}) |

*Note: If some cases are unrelated (billing, portal questions), discount them and note the total vs reviewed count.*

**Case breakdown by technical area:**
| Technical Area | Count |
|----------------|-------|
| Connectivity / Networking | {N} ({%}) |
| Upgrade Activity | {N} ({%}) |
| Performance Issues | {N} ({%}) |
| Query & Index Issues | {N} ({%}) |
| Application / Client Side | {N} ({%}) |
| Resilience / DR Activity | {N} ({%}) |
| Terraform / CLI / API tools | {N} ({%}) |
| Atlas Administration Issues | {N} ({%}) |

## Recommendations
{Use a markdown table for recommendations. Each row should map to a specific risk and be specific about deliverables.}

| # | Recommendation | Severity | Deliverable | Expected Outcome |
|---|----------------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | {Specific action} | Critical Risk #1 | {Concrete deliverable} | {Expected outcome} |
| 2 | {Specific action} | Critical Risk #2 | {Concrete deliverable} | {Expected outcome} |
| 3 | {Specific action} | Significant Risk #3 | {Concrete deliverable} | {Expected outcome} |
| 4 | {Specific action} | Roadmap Planning Risk #N | {Concrete deliverable} | {Expected outcome} |

## Notes & Anecdotes
{Bullet points of raw observations from case review. Focus on behavioral patterns:
- Recommendations that went unimplemented or unacknowledged
- Cases that auto-closed due to lack of customer response
- Patterns of case severity mis-selection
- Recurring issues that could have been prevented
- Customer engagement quality with Technical Support
Include specific case numbers and source attribution for each observation.}

## Appendix
### A. Referenced Artifacts
| Artifact | Type | Link |
|----------|------|------|
### B. Case Review Detail
{Group by technical theme (e.g. "High CPU / Node Performance Issues", "Memory Management Issues", etc.). Under each theme, describe the pattern across cases with specific case references.}
### C. Account Timeline
| Date | Ticket / Reference | Summary |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| {Mon DD, YY} | {Case/HELP/Slack link} | {What happened and outcome} |
### D. LGTM Tracking
| Reviewer | Role | LGTM Date |
|----------|------|-----------|
| {name or —} | AE | — |
| {name or —} | CSM | — |
| {name or —} | PS | — |
\`\`\`

## Step 5 — Review Checklist
- All risks supported by case numbers / PS references
- Severity ratings justified and consistent
- Confidence reflects actual data quality
- Recommendations are specific and actionable
- No customer-sensitive info included
- Case counts and timeline accurate
- Executive summary matches findings

## Step 6 — Delivery
Acquire LGTM from AE, CSM, PS, TS. Deliver to account team only. Any customer-facing share should be a presentation at a QBR, not the raw register.
